# Dino game (chorme) with AI

I challenged myself to make a Dino game and then create an AI to play it.

For can play you will need of Pygame module

´´´´bash
    pip install pygame
´´´´

and to do IA play it was using NEAT

´´´´bash
    pip install neat-python
´´´´

# What is NEAT?

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a machine learning technique used to evolve artificial neural networks. It combines genetic algorithms with neural networks to evolve solutions to complex tasks. In this case, the NEAT algorithm helps train the AI to play the Dino game.

The AI's settings can be adjusted in the "config.txt" file, such as the number of dinosaurs trained per generation.

Have 9 inputs where calulat diferent distance between dino and cactu or bird on position x and y, two outputs that determined whether the dinosaur should jump, squat or neither.
